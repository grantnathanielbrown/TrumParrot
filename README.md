## OVERVIEW

The goal of this project is to learn about data/data visualization in React/JavaScript. I converted and modified data about Donald Trump's daily approval rating and Twitter usage. My hypothesis is that a larger positive/negative shift in Trump's daily approval ratings will result in a higher number of tweets per day.

## MVP
- Some kind of ability to affect the timeframe of the graph, whether it be typing in a time period to look at, or dragging mouse across the graph to select the timeframe.
- approval change, number of tweets per day, overall approval rating are all shown on the graph
- ability to hide/show different aforementioned items
