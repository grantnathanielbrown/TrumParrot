## OVERVIEW

The goal of this project is to learn about data/data visualization in React/JavaScript. I converted and modified data about Donald Trump's daily approval rating and Twitter usage. My hypothesis is that a larger positive/negative shift in Trump's daily approval ratings will result in a higher number of tweets per day.
