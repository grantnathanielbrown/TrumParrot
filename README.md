## OVERVIEW

The goal of this project is to learn about data/data visualization in React/JavaScript. I modified and combined other data sets to create a data set containing Donald Trump's daily shift in approval rating (according to 538), his overall approval rating as an average of different polls, and the number of tweets for each calendar day between January 2017 => January 2021. My hypothesis is that the larger a positive/negative shift in Trump's daily approval rating is, the more he will tweet.

## MVP
- Some kind of ability to affect the timeframe of the graph, whether it be typing in a time period to look at, or dragging mouse across the graph to select the timeframe.
- approval change, number of tweets per day, overall approval rating are all shown on the graph
- ability to hide/show different aforementioned items
